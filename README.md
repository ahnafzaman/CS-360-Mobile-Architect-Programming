The Inventory Management application was designed to address the needs of users requiring an efficient way to manage and track their inventory. The primary goals were to create a user-friendly interface that allows for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory items. Key screens included a login screen for secure user access, an inventory display screen for managing items in a grid format, and an SMS permission screen for sending notifications. These screens were designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, ensuring a seamless user experience. The design choices allowed for a successful creation of an intuitive application that meets the needs of both small business owners and individuals.

Throughout the coding process, I focused on writing modular, maintainable, and readable code by utilizing proper naming conventions and in-line comments. Using SQLite for persistent data storage, I ensured that user data was preserved even when the app was closed. I continuously tested the app using the Android Emulator to verify its functionality, jumping on opportunities of improvement and ensuring a robust final product. It was necessary to come up with creative solutions in order to address challenges like managing user permissions and real-time data updates necessitated, which improved my abilities in database management and mobile app development. This project highlighted my capability of developing functional, user-centric application also giving me confidence on my preparedness for future development projects.
